# Graduate admission Prediction Project:

Differnent types of score are present as features in datset.

According to the features we want to we want to set prediction in terms of percentage.

Target column is Percentage of getting chances of admission.

So we see that from pairplot that all featues are highly corealated with target variable so choose linear regression model.

And check model performance  on the basis of r2 scre which is very good 0.82.
