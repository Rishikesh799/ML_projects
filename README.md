# Insurance Project

Content
Information about Columns:

age: age of primary beneficiary

sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male

bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height,
objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9

children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents

smoker: Smoking

region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

As per given data we want to predict the charges required for insurance,and which suitable model is fit to this dataset for prediction.


# Graduate admission Prediction Project:

Differnent types of score are present as features in datset.

According to the features we want to we want to set prediction in terms of percentage.

Target column is Percentage of getting chances of admission.

So we see that from pairplot that all featues are highly corealated with target variable so choose linear regression model.

And check model performance  on the basis of r2 score which is very good 0.82. 


# Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning_rishi

Task :
Predicting the heart disease on the basis of data which provoide by medical organisation.
Attributes of dataset:
1) age

2) sex

3) chest pain type (4 values)

4) resting blood pressure

5) serum cholestoral in mg/dl

6) fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

7) resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)

8) maximum heart rate achieved

9) exercise induced angina

10) induced by exercise relative to rest

11) the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

12) number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

13) thal: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect
